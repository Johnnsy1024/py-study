Perseverance is based upon the Mars Science Laboratory heritage architecture, and as such is a step-wise improvement on tested technology. The instruments on Perseverance rover are similar to the Curiosity rover, some are more powerful upgrades of previous instruments and others have completely different, and new capabilities. Among these, at the end of the rover’s arm, is an instrument known as SHERLOC (Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals). SHERLOC will be used to study rock surfaces, and will work in tandem with a second instrument named WATSON (Wide Angle Topographic Sensor for Operations and eNgineering), a camera that can take close-up pictures of rock textures.

Spitzer’s infrared eyes also allowed astronomers to see cooler objects in space, like failed stars (brown dwarfs), extrasolar planets, giant molecular clouds, and organic molecules that may hold the secret to life on other planets.Significant Findings\nOver its sixteen years in space, NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope evolved into a premier tool for studying exoplanets. Spitzer marked a new age in planetary science by being the first telescope to directly detect light of planets outside of the Solar System, essentially allowing “extrasolar” planets to be directly studied and compared.Explore Spitzer’s extensive image gallery. Tour the Milky Way with a new zoomable, 360-degree mosaic (Glimpse360: Spitzer’s Infrared Milky Way).NASA Astrobiology Involvement\nResearchers supported by the NASA Astrobiology Program are involved in numerous aspects of the Spitzer Space Telescope mission. Astrobiologists use data from Spitzer to study questions relevant to life’s potential in the Universe. This includes data that is used to understand how habitable worlds might form around distant stars, and the study of astrobiology targets in our own solar system including cometary dust.Spitzer’s observations of molecules in space are used to determine the inventory of materials that could play a role in life’s origins. This information is useful in determining how life may have originated on Earth, as well as the potential for life on other planets.Spitzer data has also provided details about atmospheric chemistry on other worlds including Neptune and Saturn’s moon Titan. Astrobiologists use this knowledge to better understand the past, present, and future habitability of Earth through comparative planetology, and to determine the potential for habitable environments on rocky bodies like Titan.The Astrobiologists\nMany astrobiolgists supported by elements of the Astrobiology Program are involved in the Spitzer mission and the analysis of Spitzer data.Researchers working on projects funded through Emerging Worlds Program include: Diane H. Wooden at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and Hope A. Ishii at the University of Hawaii.Researchers working on projects funded through the Laboratory Analysis of Returned Samples (LARS) Program include: Hope A. Ishii at the University of Hawaii and Michael E. Zolensky at NASAJSC.NAINASA Ames Research Center Team Lead Co-I Lou Allamandola and others produced spectral databases of ices, PAHs and organic residues that are used to interpret data taken by Spitzer. Co-I’s Uma Gorti and David Hollenbach are investigating basic protoplanetary disk physics and disk dissipation theories using Spitzer data.NAI Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Team member Doug Whittet is a funded user of the Spitzer Space Telescope through the General Observer and Archival Research programs. He is analysing data on interstellar origins of preplanetary matter.NAIVPL at University of Washington PI Victoria Meadows and UW Astrobiology graduate student Darci Snowden used Spitzer observations of Titan to search for novel hydrocarbons to constrain models of organic formation on Titan. VPL team members Grillmair and Meadows have used Spitzer data of Titan, Neptune and the extrasolar planet HD189733b to continue their studies into detectability and retrieval of planetary composition from astronomical data.NAI Carnegie Institution of Washington Team Co-I Weinberger collects and analyses data from Spitzer to augment her studies of protoplanetary disks."},
{"title": ["Gaia"], "desc": ["Capturing a three-dimensional map of our Galaxy"], "content": "Mission Overview\nThe European Space Agency’s (ESA) Gaia telescope is an ambitious mission to chart a three-dimensional map of our Galaxy, the Milky Way, in the process revealing the composition, formation and evolution of the Galaxy. Gaia will provide unprecedented positional and radial velocity measurements with the accuracies needed to produce a stereoscopic and kinematic census of about one billion stars in our Galaxy and throughout the Local Group. This amounts to about 1 per cent of the Galactic stellar population.Relevance to Astrobiology\nWith its all-sky survey of the position, brightness and motion of over one billion stars in our Milky Way galaxy, Gaia will provide a large dataset to search for exoplanets. These will be uncovered by monitoring tiny changes in a star’s position and motion caused by the gravitational pull of one or more planets around it, and by looking for dips in the stellar light caused by a planet transiting in front of its parent star. Gaia will also map thousands of Solar System objects, primarily main belt asteroids circling the Sun between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. With its ability to detect faint and fast-moving objects, it is expected that Gaia will also detect several thousand Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), which are thought to be comets and asteroids that have been nudged by the gravitational attraction of nearby planets into orbits that allow them to enter the Earth’s neighbourhood.NASA Astrobiology Involvement\nData from Gaia informs numerous studies supported by the NASA Astrobiology Program. Gaia measures the position and motion of stars using a technique known as parallax, which involves looking at an object from different perspectives. From it’s position in space, Gaia is able to avoid atmospheric distortion when making its observations, and provide more precise estimates of stellar sizes. Ultimately, this helps in estimating the sizes of planets orbiting distant stars.The Astrobiologists\nGaia data will contribute to exoplanet studies performed by researchers supported by elements of the NASA Astrobiology Program, including NExSS."},

OSIRIS-REx launched from Cape Canaveral at 7:05 p.m. EDT on September 8, 2016. OSIRIS-REx completed its 1.2 billion-mile (2 billion-kilometer) journey to arrive at the asteroid Bennu on December 3, 2018. The spacecraft successfully collected and stowed samples from the asteroid in October of 2020 in preparation for its return to Earth.Relevance to Astrobiology\nAs the leftover debris from the solar system formation process that began over four billion years ago, asteroids can teach us a lot about the history of the Sun and planets. OSIRIS-REx traveled to Bennu, a carbon-rich asteroid that records the earliest history of our Solar System, and is bringing a piece of it back to Earth. Bennu may contain the molecular precursors to the origin of life and the Earth’s oceans. Bennu is also a potentially hazardous asteroid that has a relatively high probability of impacting the Earth late in the 22nd century. OSIRIS-REx will determine Bennu’s physical and chemical properties, which could be critical for developing an impact mitigation mission in the future.The Astrobiologists\nNumerous astrobiologists supported by the NASA Astrobiology Program will be taking part in studying materials returned by the OSIRIS-REx mission.The Astrobiology Analytical Laboratory (AAL) of the Goddard Center for Astrobiology (GCA) is dedicated to the study of organic compounds derived from past and future sample return missions, and is an active participant in the OSIRIS-REx mission. The GCA was a member of the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) (CAN 7).Dr. Scott Sandford, member of the former NAI Ames Research Center Team, plays a number of roles on the mission and will participate in the study of the returned samples, with an emphasis on the analyses of any organic materials they contain."},
{"title": ["New Horizons"], "desc": ["The First Mission to the Pluto System and the Kuiper Belt"], "content": "Mission Overview\nThe New Horizons mission is helping astrobiologists understand worlds at the edge of our solar system by making the first reconnaissance of the Pluto system and venturing deeper into the distant, mysterious Kuiper Belt – a relic of solar system formation.Relevance to Astrobiology\nNew Horizons has revealed a plethora of information about the geology, composition and atmosphere of Pluto. In addition, the mission has provided scientists with detailed information about Pluto’s moons. After its visit to Pluto, the mission moved on to continue exploring objects at the distant reaches of our solar system. Studying primitive icy worlds at the edge of the Solar System addresses major goals of the Astrobiology Program concerning the chemical endowment of all the planets including Earth. Objects in this region of space contain a record of ancient solar system materials. Studying icy objects of the outer Solar System can help us understand what the planet were built from. In addition, it is thought that objects from Solar System’s outer reaches are occasionally pulled closer to the Sun, colliding with planets like Earth and delivering ingredients that could have been necessary for the origins of life as we know it.On its journey to Pluto, New Horizons also gathered three years worth of data on the solar wind and the space environment of the outer Solar System. This data will help scientists test and improve models of the space environment throughout the Solar System."},
{"title": ["Voyager 1 and Voyager 2"], "desc": ["Voyager Interstellar Mission"], "content": "Mission OverviewThe primary mission of the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft was to explore the outer planets of Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 launched on August 20, 1977, from Cape Canaveral, Florida aboard a Titan-Centaur rocket. On September 5, Voyager 1 launched, also from Cape Canaveral aboard a Titan-Centaur rocket. The Voyager Interstellar Mission was the first to provide humankind with a close-up view of the outer planets. Between them, Voyager 1 and 2 explored all the giant planets of our outer solar system, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune; 48 of their moons; and the unique system of rings and magnetic fields those planets possess. Relevance to AstrobiologyThe twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft are now exploring reaches of space where nothing from Earth has flown before. The twin spacecraft are continuing on their more-than-37-year journey that began with their respective launches in 1977. Each spacecraft is now traveling further from the Earth and the Sun than Pluto.After making a string of discoveries there — such as active volcanoes on Jupiter’s moon Io and intricacies of Saturn’s rings — the mission was extended. Voyager 2 went on to explore Uranus and Neptune, and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets. The adventurers’ current mission, the Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM), will explore the outermost edge of the Sun’s domain. And beyond.NASA Astrobiology InvolvementThe Voyager mission has dramatically shaped our understanding of the Solar System and the potential for life on our system’s planets and moons. It was data from Voyager that first raised questions about the potential for liquid water beneath the icy crust of Jupiter’s moon Europa. Voyager also revealed that Saturn’s moon Titan was shrouded in a thick atmospheric haze, a finding that ultimately led to the development of the Cassini-Huygens mission. Astrobiologists today still use data from Voyager, revealing more and more clues about the worlds that circle the Sun beyond the Asteroid Belt."}
