The Roman Space Telescope is currently planned for launch in the mid-2020s. The telescope was initially developed as the Wide Field InfraRed Survey Telescope (WFIRST), and renamed in 2020 to honor Nancy Grace Roman, NASA’s first Chief of Astronomy. Roman has been called the “mother” of NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.Mission Overview\nThe Roman Space Telescope will have a field of view that is 100 times greater than the Hubble infrared instrument, capturing more of the sky with less observing time. As the primary instrument, the Wide Field Instrument will measure light from a billion galaxies over the course of the mission lifetime. It will perform a microlensing survey of the inner Milky Way to find ~2,600 exoplanets. The Coronagraph Instrument will perform high contrast imaging and spectroscopy of dozens of individual nearby exoplanets. The Roman Space Telescope is designed for a 6 year mission, and will launch on a EELV out of Cape Canaveral.Relevance to Astrobiology\nThe Roman Space Telescope will make observations that could contribute to the discovery of new worlds beyond our solar system and advance the search for extrasolar planets that could be suitable for life.NASA Astrobiology Involvement\nMany astrobiolgists supported by elements of the Astrobiology Program are involved in the development of the Roman Space Telescope mission. Astrobiologists studying the potential for life on extrasolar planets provide valuable insight into mission requirements for the mission.

{"title": ["Europa Clipper Mission"], "desc": ["Europa Clipper would conduct detailed reconnaissance of Jupiter's moon Europa and investigate whether the icy moon could harbor conditions suitable for life."], "content": "Mission OverviewThe Europa Clipper mission will place a spacecraft in orbit around Jupiter in order to perform a detailed investigation of the giant planet’s moon Europa. Europa shows strong evidence for an ocean of liquid water beneath its icy crust and some astrobiologists believe that it could host conditions favorable for life. The mission will send a highly capable, radiation-tolerant spacecraft into a long, looping orbit around Jupiter to perform repeated close flybys of Europa.NASA has selected nine science instruments for a the Europa Clipper mission. The selected payload includes cameras and spectrometers to produce high-resolution images of Europa’s surface and determine its composition.The nominal Europa Clipper would perform 45 flybys of Europa at altitudes varying from 1700 miles to 16 miles (2700 kilometres to 25 kilometres) above the surface.Relevance to AstrobiologyA primary objective of the Europa Clipper mission is to determine the thickness of the Europa’s icy shell and to search for subsurface lakes similar to those beneath Antarctica’s ice sheet. The mission will also  measure the strength and direction of the moon’s magnetic field, which would allow scientists to determine the depth and salinity of its ocean. A thermal instrument will survey Europa’s frozen surface in search of recent eruptions of warmer water at or near the surface, while additional instruments will search for evidence of water and tiny particles in the moon’s thin atmosphere. Studying the composition of expected water vapor plumes on Europa would help scientists investigate the chemical makeup of Europa’s potentially habitable environment while minimizing the need to drill through layers of ice. NASA Astrobiology InvolvementThe NASA Astrobiology Program supports numerous astrobiologists that are involved in the definition of science goals for Europa Clipper and the design of scientific instruments for the mission.

{"title": ["Rosalind Franklin ExoMars Rover"], "desc": ["Establishing if life ever existed on Mars"], "content": "Mission Overview\nThe European Space Agency’s Exobiology on Mars (ExoMars) program includes a series of missions designed to study the potential for past life on the red planet. The first phase ExoMars was the launch of the Trace Gas Orbiter in 2016. The next step for ExoMars is the delivery of the rover, Rosalind Franklin, to the martian surface. Rosalind Franklin is equipped with cameras as well as a drill that will allow the rover to drill up to two meters and collect data from the sub-surface of the planet. An onboard laboratory will process samples and deliver them to three instruments. Minerals will be characterized by the MicrOmega instrument; a Raman spectrometer will provide data concerning mineralogical composition; and part of the Mars Organics Molecule Analyser (MOMA) will study and identify soil chemistry.Relevance to Astrobiology\nThe science objectives of the Rosalind Franklin rover have direct relevance to astrobiology. A major goal of the mission is to look for organics in samples collected by the rover’s drilling efforts. After pristine material is gathered from beneath the martian surface, samples of particular scientific interest will be placed in the MOMA ovens. Vapor released from heated samples will be analyzed with gas chromatography for traces of organic compounds. Organic compounds are chemicals that contain carbon, and are not themselves a sign of life. However, certain specific organic molecules are found in cells and, if discovered, might provide clues about the potential for life on Mars. NASA Astrobiology Involvement\nThe NASA Astrobiology Program has contributed resources to aid in the scientific, engineering, and technical development of the ExoMars Rosalind Franklin rover. NASA’s participation includes providing critical elements to the rover’s astrobiology instrument, the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA). MOMA is designed to examine organic molecules, the chemical building blocks of life.The AstrobiologistsESA’s ExoMars program will provide an immense contribution to the body of knowledge about Mars’ past and present. Astrobiologists supported by the NASA Astrobiology program will use this data to further our understanding of past environments on Mars that could have been habitable for life as we know it.In addition to supporting the MOMA instrument, international scientists with strong ties to the Astrobiology Program are directly involved with all stages of the ExoMars mission, including researchers with the The Astrobiology Society of Britain (ASB). The ASB was an international partner of the former NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) element of the NASA Astrobiology Program."},
